But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth Prison is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth. Favourite offices will also return. Meg Jackson carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett, the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson, the crusading Lawyer and Matthew Fletcher who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face, Meg's husband Will Jackson, whose past still haunts him. Each episode explores an individual character's back story, providing an insight to what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to Wentworth. In doing so we discover that the difference between an inmate and an officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways.

The drama starts when the police storm into Omer's bedroom when he is still sleeping. He gets arrested for a murder and robbery at the casino the night before. Omer gets imprisoned for the crime - his life is shattered, friends and fiancé disappear. Instead, one single question is on his mind for the next ten years: Why?

Omer's two best friends Ali and Cengiz were convinced to rob the casino by the mafioso Serdar Tezcan , who also happens to be Omer's girlfriend Eysan's father. Serdar created the whole plan. He needed four people for a successful robbery. The first, Cengiz would be the mole who was working in the casino and who would therefore gain access. The second, Ali would be the ruthless killer who has no problem committing murder if needed. The third, Eysan would be the skilled con-woman who would manipulate the characters. Finally, Omer would be blamed for the robbery by way of implanting false evidence, and therefore misleading the police and causing them to cease all other investigations. Eysan would later testify in court in order to re-establish the evidence and accusations, thus cementing her betrayal. The plan worked successfully and while all 4 got away with millions of dollars' worth of money, Omer went to jail the day after he proposed to Eysan.

It, too, was a huge success, and also marked a return to the game's tried-and-true formula of answers and questions (after a slightly-modified remake six years earlier failed to catch on). Three contestants, including a returning champion, competed. Six categories are announced (e.g., Art World, Cooking, 20th Century Republicans, ""Friends (1994)"", Muscle Men and College Girls Wearing White T-shirts), each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty, from $100 to $500. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g., ""College Girls Wearing White T-shirts for $100""), to which host Trebek reads the answer (""Inspector 12 must give her seal of approval before a college girl can wear one of these plain white T-shirts""). Contestants had to respond in question form (""What is Hanes?"") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was ""always in jeopardy"") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated; some answers made use of audio and/or Video clues. Hidden behind one of the answers was a ""Daily Double"" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings or up to $500 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into ""Double Jeopardy!"" Gameplay was the same in ""Double Jeopardy!"" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $200 to $1,000 and two ""Daily Double"" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $1,000 if they had less). At the end of the ""Double Jeopardy!"" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play ""Final Jeopardy!""; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was disqualified from further play. Trebek announced a category, and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however, any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. The contestant with the most cash was champion, kept his/her winnings and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated and, starting in 1997, also won a new car) or until they were defeated. All five-time champions and other high-scoring contestants over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions, the winner earning an additional $100,000; there were also teen, college, senior and international tournaments and celebrity shows conducted (the winners of the non-celebrity tournaments also earned a spot in the Tournament of Champions). In the fall of 2001, several changes were made, including the use of a ""Clue Crew"" (new regulars illustrating answers in selected categories by going ""on location""), and an increase in the dollar values of the answers (from $200 to $1,000 in Jeopardy! and $400 to $2,000 in Double Jeopardy!) ; another running change through the years was the addition of ""celebrity guests"" reading certain answers. None of the changes altered the basic game play, however. —Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>",8.2,6339,Game-Show

Tony's ultimate downfall may be one of two women in his life: Poppy, Johnny's girlfriend to who Tony is attracted; and Tony's eighteen year old sister, Cesca, who is self-professed to be older mentally than her years much to Tony's chagrin, he who will do anything to protect her innocence.

The film tells about the origin of the idea, the preparations, and the events on the trip. The ""Kon-Tiki"" was named after the Inca sun god, Viracocha, and ""Kon-Tiki"" is an old name for this god. Heyerdahl filmed the expedition, which later became the Academy Award winning documentary in 1951, and he wrote a book about the expedition that was translated into 70 languages and sold more than 50 millions copies around the world. Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in pre-Columbian times, although most anthropologists now believe they did not. Anyway he proved that it was possible by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at that time. The trip took 101 days over 4,300 miles across the Pacific Ocean before the ""Kon-Tiki"" crashed onto the dangerous reefs outside Raroia in the Tuamotu Islands on August 7, 1947.

In another vision, Ethan sees that Jesse is Horace Black, and plans to use the box to trap the souls of teens going to see a Movie premiere to resurrect the souls of his ancient cult during the lunar eclipse occurring on that same night. Benny's grandmother, who reveals that she is an Earth Priestess, gives Ethan, Benny and Sarah enchanted daggers and a spellbook to defeat the vampires. She explains that Ethan sees visions because he is a Seer, which enables him to see visions through touch, and that Benny is a spellmaster, allowing him to cast spells. At the theater, the vampires begin to steal the souls of the teens, but are thwarted by Ethan, Benny and Sarah. Jesse escapes and Ethan and Benny follow in pursuit. In another vision, Ethan sees the tree he saw inside the old book, realizing it's the tree in his backyard, where they find Jesse.

So what happened to turn this innocent teenager into the sad, angry man that we see now? Boys (Jonas) is an engrossing mystery that will keep you guessing from the first minute to the last. As it moves back and forth between its two timelines, the film succeeds as both a sweet coming-of-age love story and a dark suspense thriller. As these two perfectly-told stories intertwine, it makes for a totally unique and truly special cinematic experience. -- Stephen K. Weisenreder",7,4771,"Drama,Mystery,Romance"

She's full of accusations, he's (Massimiliano Gallo) full of excuses, and it's not until he's asleep during the flight that she looks at his phone and screams, right over the beginning of the credits sequence. The next mini-film is relatively heavy drama, and plays out during one late night, with Mastandrea playing a husband whose wife (Valentina Cervi) pries and pries and pries until he spills every detail about an affair he had. In another Short, Scamarcio is a salesman on the road, in a hotel for a conference; he thinks he's suave, tells jokes that make the listeners feel as if they're in prison, and hits on anything that moves. He eventually ends up in a co-worker's room, desperately cajoling her to sleep with him. He's very grabby which is very ""funny"" (read: not funny) and a laughingstock among the other salespeople - Mastandrea is one of them, who actually succeeds with the ladies - but he either isn't aware or doesn't care. The next Short stars Mastandrea as a sad bald man who routinely visits the glory hole at a local brothel - yes, until his wife (Marina Fois) begins to suspect something's up.

tt7937168,La trinchera infinita,"2,270",,147,Movie,Spain,Spanish,1936. A country taken by the fascism. A husband marked for the killing. A wife determined to all for saving him. An endless incarceration in his own home.,"The film starts in 1936. In a small and remote inland town of Andalusia (southern Spain), Higinio is a tailor and a town councilor who has recently got married to Rosa. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Higinio hides in his own house awaiting the right moment to escape with his wife. But he is caught in his attempt by his neighbor, Gonzalo, who blames Higinio for his brother's death and is looking for revenge. Captured by Franco's soldiers, Higinio is driven by truck, along with other opposition prisoners, to a nearby prison. But an unwitting distraction from one of the prisoners gives him a chance to escape. He runs across the town to his house where he is to remain hidden in a secret hole. In the meantime, Gonzalo pays Higinio's wife occasional visits in the belief that she knows his whereabouts. When the civil war comes to an end in 1939, Higinio learns from Rosa that there is a reward for capturing him as well as other insurgents. After one of her father-in-law's visit, Rosa and Higinio's father succeed in moving Higinio into the father's house. But, to their surprise, Higinio's father dies of natural causes and Rosa inherits and moves into her father-in-law's house with Higinio as the secret occupant. Rosa takes charge of her late father-in-law's sewing shop. But, with time, troubles increase: Rosa is raped by Rodrigo, a young Civil Guard and one of her regular customers. Higinio kills him and buries the body in Higinio's hiding place. A few months later Rosa tells Higinio that she's pregnant. Despite Higinio's opposition, and unsure of the paternity of the child, Rosa abandons Higinio for a few months to visit her sister in order to hide her pregnancy to the rest of the town. Alone in the house, Higinio surprises the local postman with his male lover after they break into his theoretically empty house which they intend to use as their love nest. The two of them befriend Higinio, and they promise to keep their mutual secrets. When, in 1945, World War II ends, Higinio's hopes for Allied forces defeating Franco's regime and freeing the country gradually vanish. He continues his seclusion for years to come, living with daily fear and paranoia. Jaime, Rosa's and (presumably) Higinio's son, is taught to say that he is Rosa's nephew and that his parents died when he was a baby. With the house turned into a big cell, Higinio and Rosa's relationship deteriorates due to decades of isolation, guilt and shame. In 1963, Jaime, having grown up up as an idealistic young man and, tired of a life of fear and terror, welcomes a friend home. The friend is wanted by Franco's police forces and Jaime introduces him to his father, who learns that there are many others like him in hiding. At the same time, Jaime confronts his parents about the life he has had and a determined Gonzalo keeps visiting Rosa's sewing shop, still tormented by his brother death, and obsessed with the idea of seeking revenge and kill Higinio at any cost. But then, in 1969, Higinio's life changes after he hears a special news on the radio. —Chockys",7.2,5248,"Action,Drama,History"

Johnson is seen in footage at a political march Shortly before this, at an action trying to draw attention to these hate crimes. Tragically, Johnson then becomes the next victim. Like the other suspicious deaths, Johnson's death is quickly dismissed as a ""suicide"", even though there is no evidence that Johnson was suicidal, and significant evidence that Johnson was harassed and stalked on that very night.

Footage of Johnson at political actions is included, though some might not notice Johnson at first at some of these actions and memorials, dressed down in jeans and a t-shirt, or jeans and a flannel shirt, with no wig. Stonewall veterans, AIDS activists, and early gender nonconforming and transgender activists are shown at these demonstrations, as well. The Gay Liberation Rally, where Sylvia Rivera gives the fiery ""You Listen Up!"" speech is also featured, along with with other interviews with Rivera and AIDS memorials with ACT UP and Gay Men's Health Crisis.",7.3,2461,Documentary

An Indian immigrant with a Beverly Hills base, Choudhury was a born entertainer, known for dressing in nothing more than a black speedo and a Rolex. His teaching style was tough love sprinkled with salty language and punctuated by spontaneous bursts of singing. His followers hailed him for helping them to gain confidence, lose weight, and overcome physical ailments through his specialty of hot yoga. He built a franchise empire with hundreds of Bikram studios around the world. Filmmaker Eva Orner traces Choudhury from his rise in the 1970s to his disgrace in accusations of rape and sexual harassment in more recent years. She taps a vast trove of archival footage that demonstrates Choudhury's charm and offers clues to his dark side. She conducts extensive interviews with his one-time acolytes who now feel betrayed, including yoga devotee Sarah Baughn who brought serious charges against him years before the reckoning of the #MeToo movement, and Choudhury's long-time lawyer Micki Jafa-Bodden. Over the years, Choudhury's story has received steady press coverage, but there is a fresh power in this telling, with key figures going on camera to describe their complicated journey. The film raises larger questions about the nature of leaders and followers and the corruption of messianic figures. To this day, Choudhury has evaded prosecution and continues to attract yoga students from all over the world, bringing added tension to this rigorous investigation. —Toronto International Film Festival",6.7,6014,"Crime,Documentary"

Inspired by remarkable discoveries in their young careers, these men conducted several groundbreaking studies, one of which is considered among the most comprehensive health-related investigations ever undertaken. Their research separately and independently led them to the same startling conclusion: degenerative diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and even several forms of cancer, could almost always be prevented-and in many cases reversed-by adopting a whole foods, plant-based diet. Despite the profound implications of their findings, their work has remained relatively unknown to the public. In addition, cameras follow ""reality patients"" who have chronic conditions from heart disease to diabetes.

The documentary traces Dr. Rick Strassman's government-sanctioned, human DMT research and its many trials, tribulations, and inconceivable realizations. A closer examination of DMT's effects through the lens of two traditionally opposed concepts, science and spirituality, The Spirit Molecule explores the connections between cutting-edge neuroscience, quantum physics, and human spirituality. Strassman's research, and the experiences of the human test subjects before, during, and after the intense clinical trials, raises many intriguing questions. A variety of experts voice their unique thoughts and experiences with DMT within their respective fields. As Strassman's story unfolds, the contributors weigh in on his remarkable theories, including the synthesis of DMT in our brain's pineal gland, its link to near-death & alien-abduction experiences, the history/future of psychedelics, and the uncanny likeness to ancient religious texts describing prophets with DMT-like experiences. Additionally, the intriguing similarities to the ""many-worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics lead to other fascinating discoveries. The experts offer a comprehensive collection of information, opinions, and speculation to help understand the nature of the DMT experience, and its role in human culture and the life force of our planet. Due to the profound nature, and visual phantasmagoria, of the DMT experience, the visual landscape of the film features stunning visualizations from Scott Draves (Electric Sheep), as well as a cutting-edge motion graphics, which demonstrate DMT's conceptual link to human evolution, construction of the universe, advanced neuroscience, and other alluring theories. Finally, stylized scenes reminiscent of Rod Sterling's famous Twilight Zone bookends, Joe Rogan (actor/comedian) serves as tour guide, helping navigate the expansive realms of Strassman's DMT universe.

For nearly a decade in the sport, Feliks Zemdegs from Australia, has reigned unchallenged as the king of cubers, the greatest of all time. That is, until now. The cubing world was stunned when an unknown challenger named Max Park from California took home the Gold medal in 2017 and emerged onto the global stage. Since then, Max's rise to the top has been swift and steady, save for one obstacle in his way: Feliks. The two have been trading wins and world records steadily, neither one able to truly dominate while the other still competes. But rather than developing into a bitter rivalry, Feliks and Max have instead grown their competitive relationship into a tender yet complicated friendship. Max is highly autistic and his family has been using speed cubing as a means of therapy for his nascent social skills and emotional development. They would have never guessed that Max's biggest rival in speed cubing would become his biggest ally in his struggles with autism. Our story finds Max and Feliks on the threshold of another World Championship, both driven to win but both rooting for each other's success. Between the two friends, though, there can only be one champion. Who will it be? But perhaps more importantly, will their friendship survive the answer?",7.4,2812,"Documentary,Short,Sport"

Read all","Elliot Page and Gaycation collaborator Ian Daniel shift gears with the documentary There's Something in the Water, a disturbing and, frankly, terrifying portrait of ecological and social disasters in Page's native Nova Scotia. Based on Ingrid Waldron's incendiary study, the film follows Page as she travels to rural areas of the province that are plagued by toxic fallout from industrial development. As did Waldron, the filmmakers discover that these catastrophes have been precisely placed, all in remote, low income - and very often Indigenous or Black - communities. As the filmmakers observe, your postal code determines your health. We're introduced to many courageous women. Louise, from Shelburne, gives us a tour of a neighborhood in her hometown where every house has been affected by cancer. Michele fights to protect ""A?se?k"", or Boat Harbour, once a sanctuary for Indigenous people, now plagued by toxins spewed by a pulp and paper mill. The government only began addressing this when other whiter, wealthier communities were affected. (In one stomach-churning moment, it's explained that the company went to great effort to divert the offal towards ""A?se?k"".) And a group of ""Mi?gmaq"" activists known as The Grandmothers fight to protect a river threatened by a gas company. All of it is deeply sobering and scary, but like Page and Daniel we may find solace in the bravery of their subjects, who are the kind of resourceful and compassionate people you should place your bets on. If, as Louise poignantly asks, you don't care about other people, ""What do you get up for every day?"" —Toronto International Film Festival",6.6,329,Documentary

Rival rabble-rousing ragtag organizations, the Islamist Al-Kaam Tamam and right-wing political party Maa Ka Dal separately recruit and brainwash Hafeez and Praveen to suicide bomb the conference so that they may continue to wield their local influence.

Joe meets with experts who present realistic solutions to make long-term sustainable improvements to eating behaviors and overall health.,"What began as the story of one man, is now a story about millions. After the film ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead"" documented his 60 day juice fast, Joe Cross vowed never to go on camera again. Since then, more than 20 million people have seen the film and Joe realized there's still a lot for him to learn about becoming healthy and staying that way. ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2"" taps into the tsunami of positive change that's sweeping the world when it comes to what we eat. As Joe sets out to learn how to be healthy in an unhealthy world, he talks to a wide range of experts, follows up with folks from the first film, and connects with new people along the way. Each one helps Joe learn that healthy eating is only one aspect of living a healthy life. From stay-at-home moms to world-class surgeons to office workers in Kenya, it seems like everyone is trying to be healthier, yet struggling to do so. While on the road, Joe experiences some ups and downs when it comes to managing his own weight. Joe's food battles resemble those of the everyday people he meets on his journey. Mirroring Joe's story is a series of testimonial Videos submitted by people who saw the first film; their personal, intimate and often funny stories show that wanting to change is often easier than actually doing so. Top cardiologist Dean Ornish catches Joe by surprise when he explains that community is one of the most powerful forces in shaping a person's health. Joe finds out how true this really is when he catches up with Phil Staples, the truck-driver from the first film. Five years on, Phil is his own journey with varying levels of support and is dealing with his own set of ups and downs. It's Phil's experience that shows Joe just how big of an impact community can have. Through Joe's journey and the lives of the people he meets, Joe shows us in Fat Sick & Nearly Dead 2 that most people really do have control over of their health, even if they never knew it was possible. And that the final decision about what to put in your mouth, is what Joe calls, ""The last two feet of freedom."" —Anonymous",6.4,1595,Documentary

For the first time, McCullin speaks candidly about his three-decade career covering wars and humanitarian disasters on virtually every continent and the photographs that often defined historic moments. From 1969 to 1984, he was the Sunday Times of London's star photographer, where he covered stories from the civil war in Cyprus to the war in Vietnam, from the man-made famine in Biafra to the plight of the homeless in the London of the swinging sixties. Exploring not only McCullin's life and work, but how the ethos of journalism has changed throughout his career, the film is a commentary on the history of photojournalism told through the lens of one of its most acclaimed photographers. —Anonymous",8.2,2193,Documentary

tt3290688,Revolver Rani,"4,772",,132,Movie,India,Hindi,"Alka Singh, the leader of a political party, and her obsessive love for Rohan Mehra, a rising star of Bollywood.","In the hostile territory of Chambal, the land of rebels, politicians, bullets and blood, you either live by the gun or die by the gun. Revolver Rani is set in this hostile world where there are no friends; only fragile alliances and deadly enemies that aim straight for the head. But sometimes you do not need to take lives to finish your enemies. Sometimes you just need to go for their heart. Revolver Rani is a satirical and unusual love story set against the backdrop of politics. It's about Alka Singh (Kangana Ranaut), the leader of a political party and her obsessive love for Rohan Mehra (Vir Das), a rising star of Bollywood. The elections in Gwalior have just finished and Alka's reign has come to an end. Her opposition, the Tomar party, have come into power and want to use their new position to take out Alka, but first, they want to hurt her. The Tomars kidnap Rohan from Mumbai and take him back to Gwalior with the aim to kill him. They are about to pull the trigger when Revolver Rani turns up, all guns blazing and saves his life. Revolver Rani has a very unique story at its heart that has only ever been hinted at before in Bollywood. This film will bring that story into the limelight and show the viewers what would happen if a political giant fell in love with a Bollywood star and then had to protect him from her enemies. It's a very authentic satire, littered with dead bodies, love and black comedy that builds up to an iconic climax set in the Shivpuri Bird Sanctuary (Madhya Pradesh) just before the break of dawn. Even if she is deadly, Revolver Rani needs love too. —Anonymous",4.5,1678,"Action,Comedy,Crime"

tt2064745,Web Junkie,"4,961",,74,Movie,Israel,English,"This uniquely telling film takes an entertaining and unsettling look into Chinese rehabilitation centers treating internet addiction, which the Chinese government has classified as a serious clinical disorder.","The Chinese government is the first to classify internet addiction as a clinical disorder. 'Web Junkie' identifies internet addiction and focuses on the treatment used in Chinese rehabilitation centres. The film delves into a Beijing treatment centre and explores the cases of three adolescents from the day they arrive at the treatment centre through the three-month period of being held at the centre, and then their return to their homes. The film follows both the underlying issues related to the disorders, as well as the manner and treatment the patients receive. Professor Ran Tao established the world's first internet addiction clinic, and he promises to cure children of so-called internet addiction, which has grown into one of China's most feared public health hazards. The program admits children between the ages of 13 and 18 years; they are forced to undergo military-inspired physical training and comply with monitored sleep and food standards. Throughout their stay at the clinic, they are patrolled by the military guards who protect the children's quarters, which, like prisons, are surrounded by gates and fences. Despite such conditions, parents voluntarily send their children to the treatment centre and relinquish personal involvement. There is no one-on-one therapy, and the children's psychological needs are 'met' with group therapy sessions twice a week. The treatment is very expensive, and parents often borrow money in order to afford to send their child to the clinic. For them it is worth it - steering their child away from this addiction and redeveloping direct communication skills takes priority. 'Web Junkie' provides a microcosm of modern Chinese life, examines intergenerational pressures, and takes a hard look at one of the symptoms of the internet age. —Anonymous",6.4,599,"Biography,Documentary,Drama"

The safest place for them to go is San Fermin, her hometown, about an hour away from the capital, where Juana finds not only a hiding place, but also reconnects with her past. This reconnection is personified by Ambrosio, her father and the mayor of San Fermin, with whom she had broken off relations fifteen years before. Soon Juana is going to discover that San Fermin, like many other small towns in Latin America, has become a sort of backyard to the capital and home to a large, unpopular, and undesired landfill. After saving a girl from a fire and becoming an unexpected heroine, Juana will be convinced that she can give something back to the welcoming community by working with her father on the city council. After a while, Juana will uncover a dark case of political corruption that directly involves her father and the powerful company that manages the town's landfill. This will lead her to become an inexperienced but convictional mayor, who courageously faces the various injustices that the town suffers. In the midst of enormous sacrifices to her personal life and family, Juana and her loyal team fight to mobilize the people and demand that central government put a stop to corruption. This conflict is coupled by her struggle to raise her son, who becomes more and more rebellious as the story unfolds, as well as dealing with a love triangle that forms between Juana, one of the town's police officers, and a former boyfriend from her youth. —Nimrod Amitai",7,20,Drama

When he won the Nobel prize in 1979, he became the very first Pakistani to achieve this distinction, and only the fourth from the subcontinent. Born in 1926 in a remote village in Punjab, British India, Salam was a child prodigy. He came from humble beginnings, growing up in a small brick house with a large family of eleven. While Salam's legacy looms large in the world of physics, he is largely forgotten in Pakistan because of his faith. Children do not read about him and he is still vilified and maligned by right wing clerics for being a ""Qadiani""-a derogatory term for someone belonging to the Ahmadiyya community.

Read all","Ladies First tells the story of Deepika Kumari who was born on the roadside to abject poverty in rural India, ventured out on her own at age 12 in search of food and shelter, and stumbled upon archery. Learning that team members were given a meal a day and a roof over their heads, Deepika, who'd never heard of the sport, asked for a tryout. Within four years she became the number one archer in the world, and represented India at two Olympics. We document Deepika's path to the Rio 2016 Olympics. Having to overcome the obstacles of a repressive system, she strives to achieve her dream of becoming the first Indian woman to win an Olympic Gold Medal. Talent in every country is evenly distributed amongst gender; but opportunities are unfortunately not. In India, we have squandered the unrealized talents of millions of young girls. We hope Deepika's story can help shatter India's tragedy of small expectations for girls and put LADIES FIRST. —Shaana Levy Bahl",7.2,422,"Documentary,Short,Sport"

Read all","The Unsaved is a drama about about a Sancho Panza and not a Don Quijote. It's about the every day's non-hero facing circumstances and not adventures, it's about Viorel, a 25-year-old fledgling drug dealer, from a backwater little town in the contemporary Republic of Moldova. He lives at home with his mother, his ears get red when he's nervous and he lets his days pass in the usual ""laissez-faire"" Moldavian style. He gets involved through his best friend, Goose, in small-time drug dealing, while helping him to fly a hang glider that never seems to work properly; and he falls in love with Maria, the girl who happens to cut his hair. This easy-going existentialism precipitates several possibilities, which find our hero trapped in his own indecisiveness, so finally he reckons the moment has come for him to start growing up and act like an adult. The first thing he does is get a job peeling potatoes in the police canteen in order to make his mother proud. The second thing is to quit the drug dealing and become a serious man, but not before stealing a car engine to ""tune"" Goose's hang glider or delivering some drugs in his place. The third thing as an adult is to develop a serious relationship with a young woman, Maria, who is the lover of a drug dealer in jail, and at the same time a cop's mistress of convenience. All these attempts fail to lead him to the desired state of ""adulthood"", and our man-boy becomes less and less a hero, and more of a man just trying to get by. Cornered by the cops, Viorel exchanges his freedom for his best friend. He chooses not to fight for Maria and lets her go back to her cruel lover who gets out of prison. In the end, left all alone, he sees himself faced only with a dream, Goose's broken hang glider. The naivety he brought to stealing as in loving, the persistent urge to find the meaning of life through others, the careless way in letting the hours pass by, and finally the choice of believing that flying means only falling, are just few of the little dramas that turn the prosaic poetry of this story into a liberation struggle of the day to day life. —Anonymous",6.9,422,Drama

Read all","If there was anyone you could call a true queen of J-pop, it's most definitely Utada Hikaru. She's one of the best selling artists in Japan of all time, with her debut album hitting almost 10 million copies sold. For many Western fans, she was one of the first Japanese artists to become truly popular, largely in part to a little song called ""Simple and Clean"" from the first Kingdom Hearts game. Her latest album ""Hatsukoi"" came out last year and in support, she embarked on her first full Japan tour in 12 years; ""Laughter In The Dark"". It completely sold out, and she's big enough to play stadium-sized venues. In a surprising announcement, when home and digital release details came out for a live filming of the tour, it included a Netflix announcement. The concert was filmed at the legendary Makuhari Messe in Chiba and was the final stop of her ""Laughter In The Dark"" tour. An absolutely much watch performance to be sure. She's a living legend for good reason; Utada Hikaru has one of the best voices in the world and the charisma to back it up. I was lucky enough to catch her live in New York City almost 10 years when she did a small string of shows in the states. To this day, I haven't forgotten a single moment of that night. I fell to the ground in awe when she busted out ""Passion"" from Kingdom Hearts II and doubly so when she encored with ""Simple and Clean"". There's a reason why her combined singles sales are well into double-digit millions, why her entire recent tour completely sold out, why she was chosen to represent the enormously popular Kingdom Hearts and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Hikaru Utada's ""Laughter In The Dark"" Tour releases on Netflix and other platforms June 26 2019. —theTVDB",8.3,70,Music

Their civilization still survives hidden on Colombia's highest mountain. They believe they are guardians of the world. Their leaders are trained from infancy in darkness to work by connecting with 'aluna', a cosmic consciousness. They perceive 'black lines' that connect special sites essential to life. In 1990, convinced that we were destroying the earth, they sent a warning through a British film-maker and then withdrew. They have now concluded that we cannot have grasped the warning and they have to explain it better if the world is to survive. So they recalled the film-maker and instructed him to film their demonstration of these connections, using 400km of gold thread. So begins a truly bizarre journey. We see people who have no wheel or writing, who know nothing of our world, seriously discussing dark energy with a leading astronomer and correctly identifying objects seen by the Hubble telescope. But as the journey gets under way they gradually realize that the film-maker has no idea what they are trying to demonstrate and their own arguments are treated as fantasy by a local biologist. So they change tack, taking us up into their mountain to show exactly what they mean, and then coming down to join forces with leading scientists who recognize that this is important cutting-edge knowledge dealing with a very grave issue. Their journey leads to apocalyptic horror, but in an astonishing resolution ends with an extraordinary joyful celebration of new life. —Alan Ereira",7.7,146,"Adventure,Documentary"

Players, fans, young, old, with or without a disability, male and female... millions of Africans' lives are wrapped up in the 'beautiful game'. Unlike anything else soccer brings fifty-four diverse countries into a common and passionate dialogue. And the results are tangible: when an African country does well at a competition, its national GDP rises, its exports go up, crime decreases, and political divides narrow. As Reverend Tutu shares in ""The Beautiful Game"": ""soccer isn't like a religion in Africa. It is bigger than religion"". The film interweaves a number of dynamic stories from six separate African countries: Kenya, Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast. Together these stories reveal how soccer can be an effective social and developmental tool; and how a game can play a crucial role in shaping a new future for Africa. We have threaded our stories together with stunning visuals and with insights from some of the most famous Africans.

Read all","Florian Sirko and his one-time love, Macy Patterson face a problem. A curse was originally cast from the attack of Haidamark Cossacks on Nemirov Poland, 1648, spawning a mythological creature, the Vodnik. This curse now plagues the Sirko family and the citizens of his town are paying with their souls. Macy is of course hesitant to believe urban legend as is local County Sherriff, Ben Cade, who suspects Florian is dealing with the grief of losing his brother in a more sinister way. Running parallel to the story, George Bulter III and Teddy Marsh are two culinary masters of a local greasy spoon diner trying to perfect the art of buffalo frog legs. George inherited the establishment from his Uncle Corey, who was the other boy with Dimi, Florian and Macy on the fateful day of Dimi's disappearance 20 years prior. George is convinced that his recent nightmare of a strange, larger than life creature and his frog companions are stalking him and he wants payback. As the two storylines head for a collision, both protagonists realize the only way to break the curse and send the Vodnik back to hell is for it to collect 10 souls. The problem? The creature has his eye on one final soul, Macy. —Fred Terling",7.1,62,Horror

This documentary looks chronologically at that enterprise, starting with the success of Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci: their silent anti-heroes gave Clint Eastwood and Franco Nero stardom. The genre then shifted to political films of the collective downtrodden facing the state. The genre ended, spent, in comedy and farce. Along the way, argues this documentary, the spaghetti western established a language of filmmaking rooted in post-war cynicism and moral ambiguity, with cinematic tropes, including close-ups, violence, and soundtracks, that influenced filmmaking in Hong Kong and the U.S. —<jhailey@hotmail.com>",7.2,228,Documentary

His goal is to win and save enough money to visit a long lost mom. Melinda has no skills, can barely hold a job, has a bad temper, is lonely and finds excitement in meeting new boyfriends online via the Internet. Some of these boyfriends are not good guys. Everything changes when Ricky & Melinda's corrupt nasty ex-convict uncle memo is released from prison and comes to live with them. Memo has ideas for quick and easy ways to make money, and hustles his own family. Their lives change forever when Memo is suspected of doing something in the way of insurance fraud and Ricky and Melinda are forced by circumstance to make a decision to leave Chicago. On their journey to Los Angeles Ricky & Melinda meet a lonely drifter, an anxiety ridden hitchhiker, an older Latina woman who may have lost her son in Iraq, and a young Black woman escaping new Orleans for Vegas who imparts a small selfless gift to Melinda. At the end of the Movie, Ricky & Melinda arrive in Los Angeles with little money and the expectation that everything in the end will work out for both of them. Ricky and Melinda both think they have both reached the promise land. They believe that for that one moment good luck is on their side and that they will be embraced and their life will be better. They are not ready for the reality that awaits them. In the end Ricky & Melinda come to terms with their own relationship and its meaning.

Striking extraordinary deals with the government to acquire newly privatized industries, a small group of men became phenomenally rich almost overnight. The most successful of these oligarchs was Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who quickly became the wealthiest man in Russia. But Khodorkovsky was invested not only in business, but also in true social reform and a new ideal of an open society, an attitude that ran afoul of the absolute rule of Vladimir Putin. Within months of announcing a deal which would have opened the formerly state-controlled Russian oil industry to investment by Western corporations, Khodorkovsky and his business partners were arrested and jailed for fraud and tax evasion. Tracing Khodorkovsky's dramatic, ambiguous rise to power and subsequent fall at the hands of Putin's KGB-infested government, this probing, deeply troubling documentary reveals a nation still unsure of its commitment to economic and social liberties. —Los Angeles Film Festival",7,167,Documentary

In World War Two, the Japanese presented themselves as Asia's liberators, but proved a particularly cruel occupying power. Yet the Allied victory meant liberation only in the sense of resuming colonialism, which native nationalists started to rebel against, as part of a wave of largely communist-inspired independence movements. Their leader Ho-Chi-Minh, one of a hundred pseudonyms, started theirs, the Viet Minh, initially not communist, but I the Cold War ended up following the Korean example, welcoming Chinese backing. The new de facto leaders transformed it into the Viet Kong, a guerrilla army liberating the north and a resistance movement in the south, where the French remained in control. After their bloody surprise defeat in Dien Bien Phu in the last rush to the peace agreement, the US took their place, fearing the 'domino theory' all of Asia could fall next to the red danger. —KGF Vissers",8.5,928,"Documentary,History,War"

Read all,"The Chinese government is the first to classify internet addiction as a clinical disorder. Web Junkie (2013) identifies internet addiction and focuses on the treatment used in Chinese rehabilitation centres. The film delves into a Beijing treatment centre and explores the cases of three adolescents from the day they arrive at the treatment centre through the three-month period of being held at the centre, and then their return to their homes. The film follows both the underlying issues related to the disorders, as well as the manner and treatment the patients receive. Professor Ran Tao established the world's first internet addiction clinic, and he promises to cure children of so-called internet addiction, which has grown into one of China's most feared public health hazards. The program admits children between the ages of 13 and 18 years; they are forced to undergo military-inspired physical training and comply with monitored sleep and food standards. Throughout their stay at the clinic, they are patrolled by the military guards who protect the children's quarters, which, like prisons, are surrounded by gates and fences. Despite such conditions, parents voluntarily send their children to the treatment centre and relinquish personal involvement. There is no one-on-one therapy, and the children's psychological needs are 'met' with group therapy sessions twice a week. The treatment is very expensive, and parents often borrow money in order to afford to send their child to the clinic. For them it is worth it - steering their child away from this addiction and redeveloping direct communication skills takes priority. 'Web Junkie' provides a microcosm of modern Chinese life, examines intergenerational pressures, and takes a hard look at one of the symptoms of the internet age. —Anonymous",,,Documentary

In his Cabinet is Tom Kirkman, Minister of Housing and Urban Development, which is on the lowest rung of Cabinet positions. Non-elected Tom, who was appointed from an academic career, and the President often do not see eye to eye, the latter who is losing political respect for the former. As such, the President has not included any initiatives raised by Tom in the address, and has informed Tom through his Chief of Staff Charlie Langdon that he will soon be demoted to a position based in Montreal (which is framed as a promotion) or fired if he does not accept the demotion. Further, Tom has been assigned the designated survivor for the address, meaning that he will be housed in a secret secured bunker while the rest of the Cabinet enjoys the public visibility by joining the President at the Capitol for the address. Things for all involved change drastically when the Capitol is bombed during the address - the perpetrators initially unknown - with the President and the rest of the Cabinet killed in the process, leading to Tom being appointed President, something he never saw happening or to which he would ever aspire. Tom is insecure enough in his own abilities at this crucial time, which is only exacerbated by similar views by others, including Seth Wheeler, who was President Richmond's head speech writer, and Harris Cochrane, the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Tom knows he has to look and sound Presidential to show the world that it is business as usual, meaning that his first speech, to be written by Seth in less than an hour, is of utmost importance. However, there are actions behind the scenes that could affect what happens. Through it all, Tom needs the emotional support of his family - his wife Alex, his teenaged son Leo, and adolescent daughter Penny - each who may be going through their own issues in dealing with the situation. —Huggo",8.2,3131,"Action,Drama,Mystery"

Read all","The gang is seen bending in a rock, paper, scissors fashion, saying ""One, two, three, BEND!"" Toph puts out her hand and bends a miniature pyramid, Aang sticks his hand out and creates a miniature tornado inside his palm, and when Katara puts out her hand she is seen holding a little water pinwheel. Sokka, being unable to bend, sticks his hand out, his thumb and pointer finger bent. He claims it is his boomerang. The others argue that 'boomerang' is not an element.Using Sokka as their guinea pig, Katara, Toph, and Aang each demonstrate their abilities, each trying to prove that their element is the best. Aang hits Sokka with an air blast and also hits Katara. Katara blasts Sokka into the air with her water, freezes him into a block of ice, and breaks it into small cubes of ice. Satisfied, she fuses the pieces back together.Toph tells Aang and Katara that air and water are both great elements, but that earth is better. Sokka tries to sneak away, but Toph sends him flying into a makeshift pinball machine formed out of the vertical side of a cliff and into Appa's mouth. Aang saves him, catching him in the air with his bending. Sokka thanks Aang and subsequently remarks that he is ""sick and tired of being everyone's personal dummy.""Aang promptly fills Sokka with air, inflating him like a balloon. He begins to float away, but when Appa's horn pokes Sokka's nose, the ""puffed up Sokka"" explodes. He subsequently crash lands into a pool of water, emerging carrying a fish in one hand.Zuko and Iroh suddenly appear on top of a cliff. Zuko shouts to them, asking if ""[they] call that bending"". Katara's eyes turn into hearts and she exclaims that the tiny Zuko looked cute. Zuko becomes enraged and steam begins coming out of his nostrils and mouth, and he yells that he is neither cute nor tiny, and briefly reverts to his appearance in the series. Iroh agrees with Katara, causing Zuko's temper to flare and he shoots a large blast of fire at the gang. The blast hits Sokka directly, causing the fish he was holding to catch fire and cook.Zuko claims that fire is the best and Toph takes it as a bending battle challenge. She begins to raise mountains out of the earth, and when she has finished she shows the others an aerial photograph of the mountains which form a picture of herself. Momo promptly holds up a ""7.6"" sign, Appa an ""8.2"", and Iroh claps with amazement.Aang makes a large ball of air, and using it as a trampoline, launches himself into the air, and while doing so, he breaks a piece of a cloud off and takes a bite out of it. He flies up to outer space, comes back down to earth, and lands on the ground. Momo puts up a ""6"" sign, Appa an ""8"", and Iroh shakes his finger in disappointment. Aang points out that through his performance he had made an arrow shape out of the clouds. Momo subsequently flips the ""6"" over to make a ""9"", Appa turns his ""8"" over, even though this did not change its value, and Iroh looks impressed.A nearby volcano erupts and Zuko is riding the lava. He uses his firebending to make a dragon out of the lava, shouting that he will ""bring in the heat"". Katara bursts his bubble by riding a giant wave over Zuko's dragon, putting his fire out, and leaving behind a little rock dinosaur created by the fusion of the magma and water.Iroh says that each element has its own strengths and weaknesses. Sokka eats the burnt fish as Iroh promptly claims fire is the best. He and his nephew make a quick escape, vanishing in a cloud of dust before anyone can argue.",8.6,276,"Animation,Comedy,Family"
